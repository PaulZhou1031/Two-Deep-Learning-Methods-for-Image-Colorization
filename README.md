In this project, we have developed two deep learning methods to colorize the black-and-white images. 
The first one we have uses is Latent Diffusion Model. Even though we have trained the model for 1000 epoches, the outcome is not satisfactory. The output image seems to be bluured, and there is no clear color boundary at the edge of one specific object on the image. 
Then we tried another method: using the combination of GAN and U-Net. This method clearly gives us better results. The output images have color that is close to the real life. We can clealy see the color differences between the objects on the image. 
I put the outputs from two methods in the output folder.
